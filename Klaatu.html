        <p>This video is sponsored by brilliant the first 200 people to go to brilliant.. Org / polyphonic will get 20% off an annual premium subscription when the Beatles broke up. It shocked the world in a way no band breakup ever had or ever will for nearly a decade they have been the voice of rock and roll they were the subject of Hysteria and adoration it seems wrong that these for boys from Liverpool what grown up alongside the entire generation would never make music together again eventually as with all things people moved on but then six years later a strange unknown band broke onto the scene they had an album full of psychedelic sounds ambitious arrangements and beautiful melodies the very things that the Beatles had gained a claim for in the back half of their career rumors began to spread quickly and soon people all over started to believe wanted to believe that the Beatles had gotten back together let's take a closer lookin August 1976. A band named Klaatu released their debut album 3:47 EST. The albums are working Taino words other than the group's name and the production and songwriting credits were all given to just Klaatu the album received positive praise from a few critics but soon faded Into Obscurity and perhaps that's where it would have stayed one of the countless number of well-reviewed poor selling albums forgotten in time. But it was saved from this Fate by a man named Steve Smith Smith. Was a writer for the Providence Journal that paper frequently received albums from labels who were hoping to get some reviews for their up and coming bands many of these records ended up in a record crab in full of records free for anyone at the paper to grab and take home if they so desired something about Tattoos album artwork on Steve Smith's I. And so we took it home to give it a spinupon listening Smith notice some familiar sounds on the album he picked out drumming that sounded him like Ringo Starr guitars that reminded him of John Lennon and George Harrison and even vocals reminiscent of Paul McCartney idea start to formulate in Smith's mind until we reached out to his label Capitol Records. It's worth noting here that Capitol Records had a history with the Beatles really singing number of their North American records Capitol tool Smith that the band work currently doing press and that they were a quote mystery group that wanted to be known for their music not their personalities it seemed at Lisa Smith that mystery was a particularly Choice word and bells. Went off for him. So he pitched an article to his editors who ran with it giving it the title could clock to be Beatles mystery. Is the magical tour in that P Smith discuss the album noting that the third track Dr marvello sounded like blue jay way and adding that the whole album is no magic mystery and tour Smith called Frank Davies who identified as Klaatu sort of manager recognizing the opportunity since that there were secrets to be found on clock to his album. Even said there was a message hidden in Morse code on it which Smits article hit the press. The speculation began everyone wanted to find hints that the Beatles were back in to find hints you of course needed to listen to the album on top of this radio station began to speculate and play Klaatu songs alongside that's speculation all of it helped Propel Cloud 2 from obscurity into charting success 3:47 EST climbed its way up to number 32 on the Billboard. Top 200. A pair of tracks calling occupants of interplanetary craft and sub Rosa Subway became rock radio Staples for a short.. You all over took note of the album similarity to The Beatles put the clues were just in the music. Smith's original article did its due diligence noting a number of other hints that the band could be the Beatles the biggest of these came in the band's name as a reference to a character in The 1951 sci-fi classic. The Day. The Earth Stood Still two years before Klaatu came onto the scene Ringo Starr have released a solo album called goodnight Vienna the artwork for that album was a reference to The Day. The Earth Stood. Still didn't course there was the fact that the artwork of 3:47 EST featured a sun rising a potential reference to The Beatles. Here Comes the Sun or even Sun King given the face on the Sun as with any conspiracy theory the evidence gets more tenuous from here in Smith's original article he noted that the song sir bodsworth Ruggles B3 with spell troubles be on the album cover he wrote that you could Define bugs worth Rebels be as persons of importance born of quarrying The Beatles of course went by the name The Quarrymen in the early stages of their career and then there's the fact that Subrosa Subway kind of sounds like red rose Speedway Paul McCartney second studio album Wings somewhere in all of this people also got the idea that the phrase Klaatu meant being here before another hint that the band could have been the Beatles reborn as speculation grew Capitol Records whenever press call to ask about Klaatu they would respond with half answers and cryptic statements and as clock to Mania was taking over the world we're got out the clock to recording their second album in London with the help of the London Symphony Orchestra this rumor of course gave more fuel to the conspiracy theorists but not everyone thought that this was the second coming of The Beatles new music express made the thoughts on the topic abundantly clear when they release an article about it had lined death idiot journalist starts Beetle rumor and soon enough they would be proved right. The whole conspiracy theory Came Crashing Down thanks to the Washington radio station WWDC that stations program director Dwight Douglas went to the US copyright office and looked into the copyright of the album and. Of course the names that showed up were not John Lennon Paul McCartney Ringo Starr and George Harrison instead it was Terry Draper D long and John Willis Chuck a trio of Canadian musicians why all the secrecy around their identities it turns out with their manager had told Smith in that first article was it the truth of it the band genuinely wanted their music to be judged on the Merit of the music. Alone. It was no ulterior motive for the lack of press and interviews there were just three guys that wanted to know what the world thought of their music but the unexpected Fame they gained from this and on them and he turned out to be a double-edged sword the phenomenal launched Klaatu in the spotlight for a brief moment and help them develop a cult following that still support them to this day but on the other hand of the backlash when the truth came out was severe when the iPad died radio stations moved on from their songs and then there's the fact that everyone held their future work up to the standard of some imagined Beatles reunions but for a brief period in the mid-70s Klaatu captured the world's imagination their success stands as a testament to them as a band but also to the intense love the world had for the Beatles and the desire close up the wound that formed when they disbanded which hand will be the Beatles.
