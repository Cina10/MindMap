        <p>I start by introducing myself. My name is Mark Smith. And it's my great pleasure to be the vice Chancellor of Lancaster University. It's fantastic to see such a huge turnout from the time in the region to tonight's public lecture so thank you for comingthe university university quite complex organization but. One that has many roles which we seek to play and one of them is in being a forum to stimulate and interact with our local community Lancaster. You're probably aware. Continues to be in the top 10 of all national league tables in the top 200 W University in the world and we want to compete in Campero sell for the very best universities are onone of the dangers of doing that he's that we lose sight of the fact that part of the Lancaster character is where we come from. I'm going to show you we don't lose a thought of that character we very much value the support that we get from our local community and part of this public lecture series. Is giving back to that local community something which we hope you find interesting. So that's the background to a public lecture series which is one just one of the ways we hope you believe we support the community cuz we all very clear that the community here in Lancaster or supports us to the main event. Tonight it's my great pleasure to be on to introduce a professor dying so black one of my colleagues. Now I'll give you exactly a year ago we were halfway through the process of slight the restructuring my senior team and I decided that engagement was so important the University's engagement locally and nationally and internationally. But we needed one of the senior academic my senior team who this became the core responsibility. So we would that we had that we haven't had this road before I Lancaster. And we were interviewing him because of Lancaster. We're lucky enough to attract really high quality candidates from across the country in fact internationally. And so we had a real choice. But it was no damn. And then she was safe from tonight's lecture of Sue's vision for engagement at Lancaster. Was hardly compelling and one which she hasn't bought from with us since August effect for you cuz. I had a job. Is to drive this engagement strategy but being a being a king fan of buy one get one free at the same time but we also recruited a world-leading academic because there's no doubt that Sue is one who writes this is one of the world's leading forensic anthropologists is true at you by the way it is it is actually so how could sue show more leadership but not only being the person responsible but I can doing engagement the same time. So I'm very grateful for her to give giving tonight's like Jeff Webb. She'll address some of the extensive range of casework she's been involved in which will include you see some really high-profile an interesting cases and the fact that she gets involved on behalf of the British government to lead on some of these is Testament to her standing at in the field. I'm off to Ciocca W book signing session to sue. Is just had a book come out that remains a life and death. And I'm going to tell you what is. That true story believe you want to listen to take home what has happened. But I don't regret what happened at the University front Friday of the week before lost a tweet, actually been a drone into this world of tweeting I know what your name is this book will remain so life and death is actually had won a prestigious the South price in Scotland for Book of the Year. Very nice. I said sue sue is just one of the sponsors bookings at my watch. The black just the book. So I proved in this morning and had it signed. So I did not know anything about suit. And I'd already start reading online photo scrapbook. So this will commission for my side with him should have any way to welcome Professor James Suber Country Mart central vision judgment I have to apologize for this so when I open my mouth. I'm not sure whether I'm going to sound like a chipmunk or a tuba. And I promise I don't normally signs like this. It's so bad that my husband phones be over the weekend. And I picked up the phone. And he said he was that you were a man with a relation in this place is not doing too well for me when I go into court. Is that I must promise to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God. So I'm going to ask you to do the same thing hands up. You're almost nine hands up those of you who've watched CSI shame on you shame on you because it's one of the worst programs on the television. It has nothing to do with the world in which we operate but what's really important is it for those young people who see this on television as being a career they do think that this is maybe what it's like and when are students wants to study forensic science that often really dispirited when they find they do need to learn mathematics and statistics and physics and chemistry and all those really important things it's not just about pressing on waiting for the answer to come out so if I do nothing else this evening but remind you to switch off the television when CSI fleetwood's or whatever it is comes on next, please note I have to do this I have to give a warning. I don't believe there's anything that I'm going to show you tonight off such a magnitude that you haven't seen it before it's what it what I'm used us to us these days. But it's a requirement that says what I'm going to talk about isn't here for entertainment purposes it's about letting you know what the reality of our world is like. And it's a really serious world. And it's the world that affect people's lives daily. So there is an enormous he an enormous importance to it there are things that might affect you on this. Is my gas out of jail free card. So it says if you go home tonight and kill your wife because what you saw on here was so disturbing it is not my fault it is not the University of Lancaster's fault. I gave you the warning I will try and remember where there are things that are challenging I will probably forget and have to say sorry. But I have chosen to try and look at cases. And I looked at cases sold in the UK here. I've not looked at our overseas ones because I'm going overseas ones are actually more challenging to handle. But I just want you to get an idea of the kinds of things that we really do in our world not the things that make it into the television programs when somebody says what is forensic anthropology is made up of two words. The forensic bit is the Latin bitch which means pertaining to the Forum which is where the word forensic comes from on the phone number of the Courts of Rome so anything that has the word forensic in front of it went out there to work for the police were not there to work for a lawyer we're there to give evidence to the courts and all the time from the first moment we step onto a crime scene our job is to have in our minds we are going to have to present this evidence in court and we have an adversarial court system in the UK. So we know that when we go into court one side of that room will be trying to prove that you are the world's leading expert on the other side of the room are trying to prove that you're a blithering idiot and one of them will win and you have no way of knowing who it is that's going to win the courtroom. Is somewhere that is really challenging for a scientist to be the answer Pieology bits is Greek and it just me the study of mine so when you bring it together what forensic anthropology is advised is the identification or study of the human or what remains of the human for the courtroom practices let's see if we can take out a bit further you probably because you won't see us. I think that the forensic anthropologist always deals with bones and there is a truth in that but a lot of hard work nowadays is about the living. Do you imagine someone comes into Heathrow on the papers as it goes through the board of control those papers are picked up as being false at that point they'll be picked up by border guards they will then at that point claimed most likely that they are 1704. But they will claim there are 17 because international law states that if you claim you're a child then you must be treated as a child which means you required to be highest educated to be fed into be safe the job then falls on the scientists to determine whether you're telling the truth or not and that legal definition is between the age of 17 and 18 years. Are the only thing that happens on your 18th birthday that you can remember about what you can legally go to the bar but in times of your biology nothing changes between 17 and 18. So I told this really challenging when we were Kings but a lot more if I work these days is with the Living Desert Mist coming next that shows individuals who are no longer living so we will work for those individuals who are recently deceased and that might be in my spatologie examples so for example in the London bombing we had 56 victims. But we had 1500 body parts on our job was to try and reassociate them in the human jigsaw. The just because somebody has recently lost their life doesn't mean that it's very obvious who they're going to be in a mass fatality event sometime it is extremely challenging especially if the bodies are fragmented or some fat. They're burnt. This is not pleasant but once a body starts to decompose once you start to lose that battery or if environment between your internal self and the outside world we start to lose some of the features that help to identify a facial information goes very quickly fingerprints go very quickly and then environments where we have advanced decomposition at a really rapid right then even DNA sometimes isn't going to help us because it becomes denatured. So the general principle for police officers is if what you're working with starts to smell bad we probably need a forensic anthropologist so we tend to be the bad smell science that links this. Is when you need us. This is where you're happiest with us. I suspect what does a bit of bone was the skull.. That's what forensic anthropologist do but there is another category which is the one that's coming next. And it's the one that shows that were not great company for it for dinner. Dates. You know we really are the ultimate trainspotters in the scientific world because the real challenge for off the thing that gets inside your bed in the morning. It's when we get those tiny little fragments of phonies come from the World Trade Center on our job is to identify. Are they both are they human where do they come from in the human so the absolute minutiae and details of our human anatomy R Us really critical to every aspect of our identification I firmly believe in audience participation. Let me give you the backgrounds so what we have is we have a group of children from school in Northern Ireland and they had talked to an island on the sign strip on wall right there one of the kids takes this photograph the children in Northern Ireland still aren't necessarily on the best of speaking terms with the police force necessarily. So it takes a few days before one of the children shows it to their mom who marches them done. So if we service of Northern Ireland and they have a look at this Photograph. The police are sent out to the area by the time they get there. This is missing. Are we worried that it's missing what is it. I love. It see you've already decided you don't trust me. Are we going to set up Emergency Restoration seal flipper overalls in the room tell me that you thought it was a him to the police force us to be able to identify not just what's human but all the things that are not human that might look like human body where I was at the time we have a coastline on seals get washed out repeatedly on the beach at 10. Is here. And so we got a phone call every weekend from the police since I saw it would say we find the hands on the beach. No you haven't you love finds a seal flipper have a look at it. And you are going to be out there that same darn seal flipper 12 times in the same weekend. So it's really important that when we're training people it's about identifying that they can recognize what it is they're looking at what about the one on the left are going to set up a murder investigation based on.. Let me give you the background these are find in the freezer of a known serve sympathizer in Kosovo on what his bands were doing what they were abducting young cost of Albanian men they were murdering them they were cutting the bodies into pieces and they were leaving the dismembered Parts in front of the door on the doormat of families who had young men and it was their calling card to say don't let your son join the cost of a Liberation Army because if you do then they could be the next this is a calling card dismemberment so this was fines in the freezer of a known substance either there's a problem with a photograph problem with the first graph. Is there's no scale so we don't know how big that is so do you know what type of evidence by his. And he said yes. But we can bring you another bag on the back that they brought. Was this size so what sitting on them are this size these are bearpaws. So it's a Four Paws and a hind part you can see on the other one in the lack that stack things on that. 's a really heavy animal putting huge amount of weight to the for Paul the one on the right hand side. Is a foot's turned over the other way there's no InStep on the heel at the top because he is even gates at that. 's not a pipette that's a Quadra ped. So we can have to lease a this is. Actually bearpaws. This is someone who denied comforting and these were probably going to turn out to be stopped for a pound of soup what about the ones on the right now is go to scale. Are we going to set up a station is a turnip he's really still don't trust me you are. Cuz one of them is human and two of them are chicken. So the one on the left is a human should vote it's a tibia from a newborn baby on the two on the right are chicken bones so that the job that we do is not terribly exciting sometimes. But you really do need to know you're on atomical detail and you need to round atomical detail not just of the human. But if the humidity at every age in which they occur every kind of presentation that they might give weather fragmented decomposed or intact and it takes a long time to become an experienced forensic anthropologist you did any Giants seriously why is that the most important thing is the human is a strange animal because it has the opportunity and the skill to be able to change the way it appears it is a she from the left but just because we find horns. Doesn't mean that it's not human so. What he's done is he made two little Cuts in the skin above my eyebrows he sticks in these Teflon implants with her coaches within osteogenic substance so he can grow his own Harden. Why'd you know I've no idea. It doesn't matter. But he does it so that we never ever complacent because we just don't know what we're going to be presented with sometimes what were presented with. May be old but it isn't necessarily illegal this is a human finger and when the gentleman I accidentally cut it off with a circular saw and took it to a any he stole it back from Ane he boiled it dying in his kitchen he made the catering ice of it because he thought it was a nice Christmas present for his wife and you added to giving the finger so just because we find that we have to identify as a human or is it not. But actually it wasn't a crime associated with it. I love. Is the fact that the human body is just a tapestry. It's just a canvas that we can draw on 20 years ago if we'd all star student population in Electra do you have a tattoo you get one or two now if you ask that question. Is three-quarters of the room so just doing that used to be something that was actually quite individualistic is now becoming something that is fairly mainstream when were looking at identification the way in which we can alter the body becomes extremely important and tutoring is one of those if you tattoo mama on your forearm do you know it doesn't help us because everybody's got a mom that's not going to help us. But if you can do something different. I love Survivor tattoos. Cuz I'd also tells us no point in looking for the big toe that's going to occur on that foot. So it's just it's just a clue. And it's an important clue what I also like is the fact that your Tuesdays are Incredibles. Are incredibly realistic that is attitude. And so when we're looking at the body sometimes it's difficult to know whether it's a genuine SCAR or whether it's attitude scarf. I will have to cut through the skin to be absolutely starving because something like a scar something like a tattoo may be the only thing that you have for identification of the individual our job is also to look at everybody orifice to be able to look for the things that people are going to implants within their bodies and then plant some strange things within the blood. Oh you think this is fat. Just wait for the one on the top left. You're going to love it one of my favorite ones. Is this guy. So he used to keep his mobile phone in there which I think is a great idea cuz you never run the risk of not hearing it go off with you. And now he puts his Coke can in there. But do you imagine that you find that individual. And you find that notification for us trying to figure out what it is that they've done why they have that kind of an alteration is extremely important in the identification process will have seen these. I have a daughter that has one of those. Is just absolutely pulling my goodness me. Did she get to see some photographs from me if what happens when tongue studs go wrong. One of the things that the humans do is that we think that's risky so what we then do as we say what you know, take it further and we do so you and watching you take the tongue stuff. Right. You're right. And you use a piece of cheese wire what you can do if you can count the tongue in half and anatomically. The tongue is really clever cuz the left side of the tongue is controlled by the right side of the brain right side of town is controlled by the left side of rain total in Independence movements of the two house if your tongue you can figure out your adults why people should have that done it should be individualistic because quite frankly who would want to do it it says a lot about Sunday that at one point there was one person who had tongue splitting and then five of their wonderfully clever Idiot Friends decided will not be cool. And so they all had it done. And so when something Becomes of Trends and no longer becomes specific and identifiable. Can you take it be on there. Soco show my job is to look inside people's minds and make sure there's not a zipper in there and you can take from that whatever you would like what's really important. Is the humanism was Marvel's animal that can choose to change the way that it looks and we think we have a norm. But in reality we haven't is the abnormal. That's really important let me take you through what would be considered to be a very very characteristic case in forensic anthropology darkness is about as far north in Scotland as you can go before you fall off the end. And so what we have is we have somebody going through the woods if I can give you no other advice than this if you have a dog get rid of it because 40% of unexpected dead bodies are funds by people out walking the dogs save yourself the grief so that means that walking in McDowell Woods dog finds little pilot by this point it doesn't work terribly well. But it's sitting down in the center bottom left-hand Corner. That and this is literally in the middle of the middle of nowhere and police Scotland still put out the crime scene tape because that's what PSI is too just in case are roaming deer or something you know. I did you look out the Scots pine you can see just at the top of the skull. Find us a little dark globe and does a young policeman standing beside me and it's God's my witness he said he looked up the tree. And he said just think that's important. And there's only one answer to that. Would just let me hold your coat. Some. I'm. So he climbed up the tree. Turn it up a tree. And it's the hood of a jacket and inside the hood of a jacket is the second cervical vertebra birth rate the base of your skull. And I promise you he said this God bless. And he came to think it belongs to that body just directing traffic in the island somewhere now. I suspect he's Untouchable. I have difficulty with it being a murder if the bodies had to be carried all the way up the tree to probably fold on there. So I think it probably is a suicide. But we don't know that means that we have to investigate it one of the worst things the most difficult things for police force. Is it when you have a body and you don't know who the individual is. Cuz. I know you can't talk to their family you can't talk to their colleagues other friends you can't start to peace out what might have happened to them so guessing to the name of the deceased is really important this individual has no circumstantial evidence on them. If you look on the right you can see at the top is a pair of trainers that little white area just below the trainers is a skull so that's in a slightly unusual place there are two legs so this at the text ms225. There's a pelvis in the middle you can see a little bit of the vertebral column the spine just about the middle of the photograph you can see some of the ribs hanging out. And you can see that there's a green jacket over the whole body that's a British Telecom jacket. Do what we do for a supposed to go to British Telecom. Do you have any missing engineered is there somebody you're missing. Know that doesn't mean that they ever worked for VT. But it's at least a good lead they might have bought the jacket and the jacket they might have borrowed it from somebody else. But it didn't take us. There is no circumstantial evidence for this individual we're happy that the head is done at the feet because I support the individual has gone up the tree they tied the hood of a jacket around the branch. And they probably jumped off committed suicide and also been hanging there for about 18 months probably as the body decomposes the weight of the body pools on the neck vertebra on the neck. Will separate the body will fall in One Direction second birth abroad. Normally Falls away. That's why it's in the hood of the jacket and the first brush bristles ahead going in opposite direction silver content that there isn't anything that we have to be worried about how do we identify the individual DNA. Doesn't help us because we go to DNA sample but it doesn't match anything on the DNA database no circumstantial evidence there's no fingerprints what do we know about the individual what we can tell from an anatomy good old-fashioned Anatomy is the individual's mail he was dressed out which means he wasn't built like a Russian shot with her. He was quick Asian contagion does not mean fight Kaiser cacatian pertains to the Caucasus Mountains so in terms of ancestral origin is anybody north of Saharan Africa and to the west of the Indian subcontinent in particular we reckon that he was somewhere between 20 and 25 years of age. And we reckon he was somewhere between 5:55 and 5 foot 8 inches in height if you place that profile into the police. Missing persons database it comes up with 1500 possible names. A thousand people a day are listed as missing in the UK money from come back this is fising today that's a registered as missing it's a huge problem with Townsend police officers to 1500 heises you have to narrow it down. We can sell it for teeth have been extracted. It's the same tooth in each quadrant. So there's a dentist somewhere that has done that they can't write to every dentist in the country and say have you ever had a patient has had those 40 thought they weren't reply. We know he's had a fracture to his right 8th rib. We know he's a damaged his right collarbone. His knee cap is in two places that he's had a fair bit of trauma some point in the past we were getting really smart now because we looked at when we looked at the Joint surfaces particularly in his fingers but also in in his elbow is well. We felt had a bit of joint laxity that isn't going to help us identify him so what we do is we reconstruct the face and facial reconstruction is a mix of Arts and Science we're not trying to reduce the face that looks exactly like. The missing person isn't the test over trying to do is to open up a possibility who could this person be. This goes out of town crime watch and within about 12 minutes of it going. I from crime watch. We have 25 phone calls many of them identifying him as the same named individual on one of those with his mother. So she sat down to watch crime watch. And she thought that looks like Jake has a name. And that's really important. So we will send two police officers down to that house one police officer will sit with dads in the city. The other police officer will go into the kitchen with Mom to make tea because that's what makes everything okay. I want that police officers in the kitchen with Mom they will ask some really important questions for us. Are you. The real mother are you the best mother this individual because if she is then that's great we can take her DNA sample and compare it if she's not our the birth father or we need to find siblings of the individual. What we don't ask is his dad that that one and every six children in the UK do not live with their biological father whether they know that or no as my grandmother from Glenelg. Always said you always know who your mother is and you have your mother's word for who your father might be says a lot about my family if we run.. CNA and Dad's DNA doesn't match we've caused a huge problem for that family that they didn't need so. Therefore we don't do it if Mom is Mom we run Mom's DNA. Will take Dad's DNA cuz you don't want him to feel last night. But we won't run it for a very very good reason we run the DNA and the DNA. Is in fact. Jake. So we have a positive match. What we know about Jake was it. He was male. He was slim. He was White T's 22. And he was five foot seven when we get it. Right we get it right when we get it wrong. We don't know we got it wrong because we may never identify the individual. So it is really important to get as close as we can we couldn't find his dentist who is confirmed that those teeth have been extracted. He got a bit of a kicking in a bar before he go missing and it confirms the front just that he has his party trick with a used to be able to bend his fingers back to be able to touch his forearm because he was double-jointed what happened to Jake is Heath going into trouble owing some money to some drug Runners and Shipley and he'd gone to Leeds he bought a car in an auction. Has there under a false name he driven North he live in has lived up there is somebody entirely different he was known as being an alcoholic he was known as being a drug addict and one day he decided to walk in to make the hell would he decided to climb a tree he decided to end his own life there was no crime for us to investigate but there was a really important thing for us to do which was to identify who he was because now we could return his body his family who were missing him and when we come within use. It's never good news is always bad news. But it is a kindness so when you talk to families who have a missing person they talk about their life going into a doctor that they just can't get Beyond it until they know for example what happened to that person. It's never good use but there is a kindness to it until Jake was positively identified Margaret Gardner was last seen alive and Helens Road which is just North of Glasgow in 2004. Margaret was married to John Gardner and John Gardner have an emergency man. And he had a number of businesses that he wanted to run an honest Day's latest one. Was that he wanted set up a company building kitchens and Margaret had said we're not doing it. He said I need a loan from the bank we're not doing Market went to work that morning to go to phone call. It works at said there's a problem with the loan that you two kites in the bank. This morning should you're right. That's a problem because I didn't take a loan out this morning. John has somebody's go to the bank with them to pose as his wife so that he could get the loan for his next business Margaret was furious with only a little Glasgow women could be. And she said I'm going home. He's out on his ear. I've had enough. And that was the last time that Margaret was ever seen alive when questions about where Margaret Wallace what John said was she going to die inside somewhere couldn't remember if we're friends of hers new can remember the name timing a bit of marital problems no. She hasn't been thought. So she didn't take him about phone. Now got no way of getting in touch with her trained to smell lies. And so we knew that John wasn't telling the truth. But we didn't know was what happens tomorrow. And she had a habit that every night she phones are very elderly parents to see if they would all right to ask them what did you have for yourself or. Did you go today you know. Did you watch Coronation Street or whatever it is. And she stopped doing that on the 4th of October and when you stop a habit of a lifetime. It is a red rag that says there's something to investigate the police were trying to the house Define blood around the base of the bath at tops of the bath and they find a chipped piece of tooth enamel in the un's of the bar that doesn't mean. Margaret said you could have gone into the bathroom she could have tripped the bath much would it cost reduction of the bar that would explain why you have blood in a bit of chipped tooth so it tells us something happened to Margaret but it doesn't tell us that necessarily something special has happened to her and then let me go to the kitchen then uninspired officer Swope to run the door of the washing machine and find blood around the door of the washing machine and. The blood is Margaret blocked and then in the filter of a washing machine they find something that they think is bone and the question is.. Is it. So there it is. It's about foreign. Why's it said bye to centimeter loan it couldn't be more obvious. What it is big problem was if they had taken this phone sample and run it for DNA analysis before they showed it to the Anthropologist. All the sample would have said was it's Margaret it wouldn't have told anyone what it is. And it was really important that the identification of the fragment was done before the DNA sampling the fragment of bone. Came from the greater wing of the sphenoid bone which is a bone that sits on the left side of the temple and right underneath there in the living must have blood supply there is no way that busy phone is missing for Margaret Hunter still to be alive. So it's extremely important that we were able to identify that fragments 49. Says okay let me tell you what happens when I got home. She was giving me grief like nobody's business we got a bit physical. She run away from me. I chased her. She trips on the top step of it at the kitchen door. She fell down the steps her head hit the patio and it just exploded that's what happens in CSI. It's not what happens in the real world so that tells us that he's not telling the truth cuz your head doesn't just explode what event. Did he says he picked her up and carried her into the bathroom and put her in the bath so we can explain the blood we can explain the chip taste and the reason that we find Blood and Bone in the washing machine is that you realize when you can reserve any got blood in his jumper John never did the washer so don't put the washing machine on I need it on a cold cycle with a non-biological detergent ladies if you want to destroy the evidence of cycle biological detergent are any of the DNA accidents so we were able to identify time get the DNA you then did what every good loving husband would do he wrapped her body in plastic he put it into the back of the car and he dropped her body in the river leave him and her body has never been fine so every time we find remains in Loch Lomond then it's always the question because at 5 missing people in that area is this going to be Margaret on our bodies never been fine so when we go to court we're going to court in the absence of a body with just one fragment of bone which no longer exists because we've done DNA analysis defense lawyer in Scotland with call Donald Finley Finley is a caricature of himself and he's the most ferocious defense lawyer that that exists.. Very rarely terrifying. So when you're in over does giving courts. And it's Donald his for the defense. Can I just say your heart plummets. So he leans on his desk and he pulls out Grey's Anatomy which is a huge textbook on the great flood when she drops it on the table in front of him and. This is not a professor I'm sure you know this book better than I do never seen that Edition and Jesus said I am not doubting your photo moments which means he is and he cross-examines me on the development of that burn on the the growth of fat burn on the other morphology is not bone on the front turning without bun for 4 and 1/2 hours. And that's why lawyers can be so incredibly clever. And it's about trying to prove it if we didn't know what we were talking about the case. Would have collapsed and I know don't know very well softer with us a really hard in there with me. He says yes he says. But I like to get you on the stand you to challenge the pathologist roughly easy to get White's very much. So what happened to Willis. That's a junkyard know. It's been guilty of manslaughter he was given was convicted of culpable homicide in 2005 sentence of 12 years. It was reduced to 9 he was given an early release in 2011 on what I just find that was in 2012 he got married in 00 there are some women incredibly Brave so that he got married in Blackpool in 2012 and this is his wedding photograph. So I don't know about you but being the wife of a convicted murderer. Might just give me a few sleepless nights sometimes were involved in areas where there a Fatal Farm sunflowers are particularly challenging this. Is the highest literally in the middle of nowhere it took the fire brigade by two and a half hours to get there simply because it is so remote and. It was an elderly lady who left on the road and winter time she tends to live in one room we knew that she drank a bit when you that she smoked and the heist just wouldn't talk like an absolute Tender Box and you can see the roof is gone this is what the inside of it looks like this. Is a real seen these are the kinds of things that we have to navigate our way around the intelligence suggests that she tended to sleep on my sofa bed which was in the sitting room and directly opposite the fire so our forensics strategy was to clear along a corridor Z on your hands and knees or something sexy about this. You're on your hands and knees and toes. White Teletubby suits with black plastic rubber Wellies face masks and double gloves and knee protectors and what we do is we clear the path way. And we turn right into the air if the room to for the sofa bed is the sofa bed hasn't been pulled out. So the chances are that she has not actually going to bed for the night. I'm not surprised because if she fit in there it would have been easier to find her we clear the sofa beds and you can see that it's not being told that you can see the wall behind the sofa beds that separate sitting room for bedroom. So now we have to decide in X the forensic strategy where we going to go I'll be going to go to the side of the sofa battery going to go to the front and sofa bed. Are we going to have to clear the entirety of the house which may take weeks to do so it doesn't happen in the 40 minutes of an episode that happens sometimes over days if not weeks we remove the sofa-bed. What we noticed was that there was some small gray areas just in front of the sofa beds that look like that. And you can see the tiny fragments that were talking about the one of the top there is very easy to identify it's a bit of maxilla. So it's a bit for the teeth were sitting within the bone. So we know that in fact when she's Dodge is phone in front of the sofa bed. So our job is to recover the fragments of the remains that we can find offer the fire service at this point. Said we'd never recognize that. As human material we have just skipped that's why it's really important you have forensic anthropologist at the crime scene on the top-left. Has Believe It or Not piece of arm on the right is a piece of vertebral column of mine different bones of the vertebrae are contained within the Niland that is melted a reminder of her nightdress and what we've got there is a right collarbone and you can see that it's an unusual shape and we know from her records that she fractured her right collarbone about four years before I'm. So this is all we have of her identification you can't get DNA from bone that is so Burns and. So Cal so it doesn't survive we don't have any teeth that I survived. We have no fingerprints answer the procurator-fiscal was prepared to confirm her identity just from the fact that she has a broken collar find from the past what we collected wasn't enough to fill a shoebox but what it did mean was that family did have something that they could bury off her. But we had to be able to separate her from R34 cat. As well we don't like it when we can't find bodies or when we have bodies that we can't name and a body. Was fine hanging in Baltimore which is just North of Glasgow on the rights of the Huns. And that's the stage of decomposition of the individual he was very mummified. Some children find them in the woodlands. And I thought he was a guy from 805 Guy Fawkes from City of fireworks. And if he has committed suicide We Believe forensic pathologist heads on the identification and all the forensic pathologist it said it's a male who's probably white somewhere between 20 and 45 that doesn't help anybody presidential physical holds the body for fight a year. And there's no evidence coming forward this no DNA to support this no fingerprints nothing I do identify who this person may be announced their teens go back in to see if there's anything more that we could do by this point we were able to eat to remove all of the soft tissue and get back to the Bone we could tell that he was male. He was Caucasian. He was 25 to 35 for probably in his early thirties he was somewhere between 5:48 and 6:51. So he was a tall chap. The most important thing was the pathologist had missed a number of anatomical features he had a fracture to his right mind about which it never healed. But I haven't been fractured for a short space of time quite a long time. So somehow he been in an altercation or an accident of some kind. He fractured his mandible. He had not gone for him. So he's not going to a n. D it should have been places and screwed so he's living wild with this fracture the pain must have been absolutely off the scale it must have been incredibly difficult time to eat but for whatever reason he chooses not to go into the community to be able to seek some some medical assistance so we do the same thing we reconstruct the face we scanned the skull replace the pegs into the lowest to create a skin thickness we start to build up the muscle layer we put a layer of skin over the top. And then we can reconstruct the face may look like the man from Baltimore has never been identified the police believe there was an itinerant in the area. But they don't know who he wants we hates this we hate the fact that we have a bowl. I'm somewhere out there. Hopefully there's someone who's missing him and we can't help to bring him home we hate that we also hate it when we know there is a body and we can't find it. But I understand went missing in 1957. She was a young girl who went out to get a birthday card for her mother and never returns home and Lord Mulholland who is who is. Some of the time really want ice in a limb and accuse this man of being her murderer Alexander gartshore who is deceased. He is probably the last person to ever see more alive than when he was in prison he was in prison for child sexual abuse while he was in prison he confessed to one of his cellmate. But his friends think he had done them a favor but think he would never know what we knows that Sinclair Upton died in February of 1957 which meant that there was a hole in the Grind open for the coffin of Sinclair Upton. So the implication was that stinky never having known the favor that he did the possibility is that motor is faulty was concealed in the hole in the grind that was due to be used by simpler options coffin what we do is we go to the old monkland cemetry we identify the site what we say to the police's if we're going to do these excavations that has to be done in the summer when we had a little rain and has to be when we have long days of daylight. So course we did it in January. So we had about three hours of daylight that Rain snow hail to just about everything. And it says. Clay soil which means as we stood on the clay. So it was like you no soliciting the sinking ship because we start descending into the clay so the real health and safety issues for a team let alone anything else and not fault that were a number of individuals on the right hand side of the memorial stone was Elizabeth McNeely who went in the 1976 below harness for a Sinclair. Often should have been enough Moira Anderson is in that grave we're going to be interested in the area below Sinclair options coffin and above his wife's coffin Marga often so the area of interest is going to be between there we shouldn't need to disrupt the body's on the left or disrupt the body's filter in the middle. That's the first call from that we find that's Elizabeth McNeely. That's an MDF golf in this is what happens to you when you've been buried in clay soil since the 1970s her body had turns out of a Seer which is like a grave wax Ahsoka substance so that we can still identify her features. We could still see the outlines are breast tissue but we needed to be able to make sure that it was in fact her so that we could identify as female we could identify her age her body was removed and was placed in a body bag until we could get to the coffin below the coffin below was Sinclair Upton. We knew how to build coffins in the 1950s look at that so the woods in the perfect condition Sinkler inside is skeletal but we have to make sure that I'm fat Motors note in the coffin with him. So we have to remove Sinclair enough at the coffin plate office in corruption was still on the coughing. So we knew that it was him once we cleared Sinclair Upton and we take the faceplate off. What we're really interested is what's below that because of Martyrs going to be anywhere it's going to be below the base plates for me. List that right underneath that you can get a cigarette paper in between. Is the lids of marker options coffin so wherever Moira is she's not in that space between Sinclair Upton and his wife what we think is well. Maybe she was in the coffin with her. So we have to open her coffin. Imma have to remove the contents in a fight she wasn't there and we moved over to the left that's a coffin from J's Tom. And she's not in that space. So we did a huge excavation desperate to try and find these remains but didn't happen the cases don't always work what's really important to the by the person who is driving this to find Sandra is a lady who in fact is the daughter of Alexander gartshore she is convinced that our father was a child abuser. She's convinced that our father was the murderer. And she's doing her to tell you when she's really trying to find the body to make it easier for the family I want to take you to the kind of research that I brought with me to Lancaster moving away from the dead bodies. And I'm afraid moving into a much more Sinister World in some regards teenage girl. Reported that nights her father would come into her bedroom and interfere with her she told her mother and her mother didn't believe her. She was a smart girl she puts on her Skype camera. And I don't know if you know. But if you leave your Skype camera running at night it goes into infrared mode which means you can see in the dark half past 4 in the morning. What we see is that right forearm and hands coming into view of the camera. And it's her body that you can see line horizontal. She's wearing her pajamas and the hands is just coming into touching her buttock area so that we have recorded on the video exactly what she said was happening she went to the police with it brave brave teenage girl she went to the police with. I just have to run to the Metropolitan Police. Saying I don't know what we can do with it. And they asked us if he said we don't know what we can do that either. But we do know is that veins are variable and if you're in any type look at the back of your right time and then look at the back of your left hand on the passion of veins will be difference on your right hands. Are you last time I guarantee it's on. The vice-chancellor is life are they will be different to everybody else. Is very interested in the room I guarantee that in his life as well I'm not becomes really important for identification purposes so we were able to identify the vein infrared light. The vein pattern stands are tight black tramlines so we can trace what the vein patterns are what we can then do as we know what the vein pattern is for the perpetrator what we can do. Is compare it with a suspect which is the father and they match perfectly what we don't know is how unique the veins are cuz we haven't done the research. All we can say is we can't exclude him until we go to court. And it's the first time this kind of evidence has ever been heard in a courtroom in the UK and we give the evidence excellent we get the additives and the judge says we have any type of why they are we need to send it to her yet because we need to hear weather and V what this is witchcraft or whether the science behind it because I was in an SMS to understand human variation he said we're going to let it be hard for the first time this happens with ever heard in the UK Court the journey went away that you re came back and the jury find the father not guilty I don't know who was in her bedroom at half past 4 in the morning with the same vein pattern is her. And we were devastated so we asked the virus or what did we do wrong classic. Then you blame yourself what did we do wrong what they said to me. Was the thing that incense me more than anything I've ever heard. Was it. They said don't think you did anything wrong at all the science was fine. They didn't believe the girl because she didn't cry. So there you have a young girl who is so brave to accuse her father to tell her mother to go to court because she was so contains in herself that you return. Has not to believe her the art, science has of course she will have gone back into a house with a father is being found not guilty of child abuse. I suspect she would have run away from home. I suspect she was on the streets if she was on the street she was probably into prostitution and drugs. I doubt whether she still alive and at that point we said you know there's something here that science can actually do I just directly after that a second case came in from the Metropolitan Police on this. Is a man called Dean Lewis Hardy. And he was like to be a sex tourist in Thailand. And he was going out to Thailand's. And he was taking photographs of himself abusing children as young as two years of age and the question was the first grass that we have often can we match the perpetrator to the suspect because child sexual abuse is one of those really rare crimes for the person films themselves committing the acts as you're going to rob a bank you don't feel meself robbing the bank. But if you're going to accuse a child to film yourself because you first of all want to relive the experience. But you can also use this photo Crossing films as a means of either creating an income or the sharing it with like-minded people so you become more important within the community. So we have the pictures of Dean Lewis party and we were off to look at them so if the offender SS the suspect suspect a few moves Hardy we were able to identify four point punctuated scar on his left index finger and because he was the redhead we were able to mop. Has a freckle patterns butchers individualistic as a barcode we were able to compare the skin creases across the stones the skin creases you have on your fingers are different on each of your fingers indifference Girls by the grounds I want me to write the report it went to him. And he said you know that looks like my hands which is not good enough yet.. She say it's my hun. And so he did say yes it is my hand. I did do that. And that was the first time that anybody's ever been found guilty or change to play as a result of this kind of evidence he was given a six-year sentence he's on the sex offenders register for life with a secured travel ban and then the Metropolitan Police decided they want to do a documentary called how to catch a paedophile. And I was very much against it because that why would you tell people what we do to cut to catch these people. But the outcome of it was for other people came forward and said he abused me when I was a child as well. So you got an extra 16 years. So it was very worthwhile doing. We started to do the research we started to write the papers we started to get the grunts we started to get the rewards for the work that we're doing. And you might have come across this one in Manchester in Greater Manchester which is Jaromir catch who's the Nigerian National Youth trainee pharmacist on we. Had several hours of video of rafe offenses on a child youngest two years of age and our job is to watch these videos and to look at these pictures and to be able to compare them to the suspect with the offender. Would never worked on black colored skin before so we weren't sure just how well our techniques were going to work we were able to compare vein patterns we were able to identify two points car punctuate the scar that was present on both sets of images on the backs of his hands we were able do identify clinical condition that he had the longest ring finger which is called melanin eat you which is a pigmentation that you got some some individuals with darker skin that you see it along the nail beds we were able then to be able. Too much together all of the pastor in the size of the knuckles associated with each of the Sans everything matched nothing was difference there no comments interview for she gave all the way through he turned around and said yes okay. I am guilty. I'm so getting a change-of-plea. Is the most important thing that we can do first of all because it stays a tremendous amount of money in the courtroom but it also means that the victims of these crimes don't have to give evidence in court and that's extremely important the judge said it was the most disturbing set of a magician ever seen in her life. And she said the opposite of credit to where I want to watch these videos. Cuz I want to know what are police officers in our Sciences. I've had to look at to come to this conclusion. I'm very kindly greater Manchester police gave the entire team including the science team a high Commendation of police Commendation for the work that was done. It was an incredible text book case for greater Manchester police and then you know if there is at the end of the day one that is the the ultimate it was Jaco Richard huckle Richard huckle. Was the UK's most prolific paedophile whether that's a title that is appropriate are not 91 charges of rape and molestation of children at least 23 children between the ages of six months and twelve years between 2006 to 2014 initially he denies everything and then when the reports are odds on the desk he changed his plea to guilty and he will serve at least 35 years in prison. But he was given 22 life sentences as a result of the research being know that the science does impact and effect mice on when science is used appropriately. Then it's a something that really is so communities I hate to give you these statistics. But I'm afraid they are terrifying statistics one in every six children in the UK have been exposed to sexual abuse at some point or another that's a terrifying statistic the police are looking at millions of images sometimes just caught in one troll it's a tip of an iceberg that they simply cannot arrest the way I feel because this is such an epidemic of a crime to size of children who are sexually abused by an adult don't tell anyone so there's a whole hidden elements on sat there that we know nothing about its most children are sexually abused by someone they know we're afraid of strangers most of them are well-known to the family. Really disturbing disabled children are three times more likely to be sexually abused over 47,000 cases of child sexual abuse occurs recorded in one year in the UK 230 a day this isn't something that happened somewhere else happens on our own doorstep under over 30,000 registered sex offenders child sex offenders in the UK. And this is the Resort's that we're doing here with in Lancaster. Cuz what we want to be able to do is to automate the process that we do we have a project that is about to kick off in January which is a bites how unique is the human hands. Can we really get down to the probability of the likelihood of individuals who are guilty as funded by the European research Council. We're still in Europe. So we got the funding before they close the door. And we got 2.4 million years over 5 years to do that we're going to automate the process we do on the reason we're going to do that. Is. It means that we can address more and more of these cases we can only do that we can link the cases that are not hot across the world so if we find the perpetrator with a set of photographs that was coming out of it too late we will not be able to match. That's the same perpetrator that was doing a set of images out of Malaysia for example. Answer for the first time we will be able to link these crimes globally because it is a global crime so when the vice Chancellor said the work that happens at Lancaster University is world-leading it is world leader and it was appropriate for me that this which is a huge grown for Europe to be able to give us comes to Lancaster because if we're going to do anything here what we're going to do is make sure that we Safeguard our children and the reason that we do that is because the most important job that we do is a bite this our children of Silence about what happens to them is one in every six of our children have been sexually abused and you look at the number of people in this room you know who you are. And you know what that does to our children and as a result. We can't allow that to happen this is a community in a community that is supposed to look after those who are the vulnerable in our society and there's no more where they research as far as I'm concerned then be able to turn around to one child and be able to save them and prevent them from going through that sort of distress the work that we've done in this field has taken enormous. Trump has been awarded up the Wazoo for so many things. But once it is a testament and it's my apology as well as a testament to that young girl that the court didn't believe this is her Legacy because we couldn't help her the research that came out of her case as secure 28 life sentences has secured / 3 800 duration of those individuals who choose to abuse the most vulnerable people in our society and my field there isn't research that has any more worthwhile latest and gentlemen thank you very much some things. </p>
