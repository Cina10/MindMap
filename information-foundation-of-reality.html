        <p>Set timer for computers I understand how information fits worth but you want me to do something more you want me to believe that the whole universe foundations of everything at how can you think that way we live in the age of competition and when you got a hammer everything looks like a nail so now we have computer as you know next thing the universe is just going to be a big smart a scientific and mathematical statementwhat. Is a computer let's be precise about this the computers that we have on our desktops for the computers that we have in our smartphones are devices that process information in a systematic bash their physical systems that contain bits of information and Convention electronic computer a bit as a little capacitor like a bucket for electrons that has a bucket is uncharged so there'd electrons over here that we call that a zero if you put a whole bunch of electrons over. He was in the pocket. Is charged full of electrons then we call that I want. And then when you flip phones back and forth so you and that is flipping bits in it. Bottom all computers is a device that flips bits in a systematic that can infect in order for it to do the kinds of things that are cell phones and that are our computer is in our cameras and everywhereuterus in it that they actually do the actual architecture by which they flip the bits to be very simple and. What is complicated is the program that we put in to say Okay Siri talk to me in that said I can do you get chased voice that you use it. Right. And it flips those bits in a systematic Bosch. What is the universe now we've known for more than a hundred years that every atom every elementary particle carries with it fits of information so an electron for instance it has a Spare the spin is quantized by the laws of quantum mechanics it says it can only take to distinguish will value spinning up like that spinning down like that. So it's a bit you could call spitting up. A 01what's a bit whether you call it a zero or one or. Not at bottom. The universe consists of information just like a bit in a computer except smaller and when two electrons each carrying a bit information, and they interact with each other those bits flip and they flip in a systematic way they perform a logical operation actually technically a Quantum logic operations that contains information did interact with each other and flip in a systematic fashion. Then the universe at bottom is just a big gigantic system that contains bits of information on a small scale those bits are interacting with each other in a systematic fashionthe substrate behind of computational substrate is there and the only additional question is is it really technically a digital computer so can the bit flipping that goes on the universe do the same kind of bit flipping that goes on in our smartphones. But I don't even have to argue about that because our smartphones are part of the Universe on a smartphone is allowed in indeed encouraged by the pitiful thing that goes on the universe of the fall and even more remarkably we can build quantum computers that store bets on individual atoms and Elementary particles and do this competition at this microscopic scale so the claim that the universe is a giant computerwhat is a computer technically a system that contains with some information that flips those bits in a systematic passion and that's capable of doing was called Universal computation which means basically a smartphone or computer. Can do but what is the universe. It's a system that contains bits of information at its most microscopic scale those bits at a systematic fashion. And that's certainly can do anything through the computer or smartphone and much more so when I say that the universe is a computer I'm simply stating a scientific and mathematical fact no one superficial difference is that in our computers or phones the hardware is fixed and the software enables that hard way to do lots of different things with the same hardware and wears in the universe all of the hardware is always doing the same thing as itself it's not programmed to do something different even though there's a lot moreyou two were custom Society did refer to hardware and software. But you know this distinction is not actually as precise as one like to think so what do you think of software is bits in the computer that can be put there many bits in memory that are just fixed them they never changed in fact I think that 90% Microsoft Word never changes no physically. You know those are electrons that are over there that they're supposedly software but the difference between that and Hardware is not precise in the universe as a whole Hardware is the physical substrate the quantum Fields the space-time in which these Quantum Fields move. Is the hardware. The physical stuff that's their the software for the things that are open to change that can be changed where you can flip this in a different way so that you effectively program this piece of the universe to do something different from what it would do it so for instancetalking to you. You could say that the you know the atoms and molecules in the air between us that is transmitting the sound from my mouth to your ears is Hardware but the specific way that those sound waves are waving up and down to try to construct something approximating coherent language that software you specialize in Quantum information Theory and and really figuring out how quantum computers can work a computer when you introduce the whole concept of quantum information Theory Episcopal system. Is it a universal computer or not is it Universal computer and the way that I figured that out as if I trying to make it computer. So I was trying to build quantum computers where you store bits of information on individual atoms on pins of electrons in electron zero directions say between light and matter then you could get these things to compute respect and the reason is because I realized State and so that part of the universe is already performing a computation and that when we're building our quantum computers were effectively packing in to this ongoing computation that is the universe what are the implications of the universe being a quantum computer rather than being just a computer ordinary classical computer associate computers are weirder than Costco computer so that it also allows things to be in some weird ways your own one of the same time to an electron can be spitting up and spitting down at the same time spinning sideways up and down at the same time I don't ask me what that means. It's just some weird quantum mechanical thing to be in both 0 and 1 at the same time allows computers to do many many different things at once so basically does one thing at a time to Coors you can do Tuesday even if only has one Quantum core can do with the Julian things at once called multitasking the way the universe is it means that the universe is effectively not just doing one thing that's doing multiple things at once so in addition to the reality we see here with waves crashing on the shore the wind blowing rainbows on the sky and more rain about to fall there other Quantum realities out there when everything is fine but importunate back in Boston is 0°. And you would derive those different realities from the quantum Computing nature of the universe mechanical. Is Computing sword inherits everything that a quantum computer to do so the universe by its very nature inherits his ability to do many many different things the photons in the universe at least the observable universe and numbers of particles and you can can you put some numbers to the different variations the universe can throw it out to the universe control. Grows very rapidly is the number of particles get involved so they're about two to the three hundred Elementary particles in the universe is a 300 bit bar code to label each part of things you could do with. Just three hundred quite a bit. So will it take a very tiny chunk of the universe like 300 Electronics trunk of 300 electrons could do to the 300 different thing so even a tiny fraction of the universe can do more things than there are Elementary particles in the universe. </p>
