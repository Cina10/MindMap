        <p>So I have a future on my website where every week people submit hypothetical questions for me to answer and I transfer the musing Math Science and Comics so for example one person asked what would happen if you try to hit a baseball pitched at 90% of the speed of light. So I did some calculations know normally when an object flies through the air the air will flow around the object in this case the ball would be going so fast the air molecules wouldn't have time to move out of the way the ball would smash right into and through them and the collisions with these. Are molecules would knock away the nitrogen and carbon and hydrogen from the ball fragmenting it off into tiny particles and also triggering waves of thermonuclear Fusion in the air around it. This would result in a flood of x-rays that would spread out in a bubble along with exotic particles plasma inside centered on the pitcher's mound and that would move away from the pitcher's mound slightly faster than the ballnow at this point about 30 minutes seconds in the home plate is far enough away to light has enough time to reach it which means the batter still sees the picture about to throw and has no idea that anything is wrong snow after 7 a.m. in seconds the ball reach home plate or at least the cloud of expanding plasma that used to be the ball and it will engulf the bat and the batter and the plate and The Catcher And the Umpire and start to send a greeting them all as it also starts to carry them backward through the backstop which also starts to disintegrate so if you were watching this whole thing from a hill you know ideally far away what you see is a bright flash of light that would fit over a few seconds followed by a blast wave spreading out shredding trees on houses it moves away from the stadium and. And then eventually a mushroom cloud rising up over the ruined City so the Major League Baseball rules are a little bit hazy but. Under under rule 6.02 in 5.09 I think that in this situation the batter would be considered hit by pitch and would be eligible to take first base if it still existed. So this is the kind of question I answer. And I get people riding in with a lot of other strange questions. I've I've had people that someone write and say scientifically speaking what is the best and fastest way to hide a body can you do this one soon. And I had someone right in I've had people ready in about you know. Can you prove whether or not you can find love again after your heart's broken and. And I've had people send in what are clearly homework questions they're trying to get me to do for them but. One one week a couple months ago I got a question that was actually about Google if all Digital Data in the world were store on Punch Cards. How big would Google's data warehouse be now Google's pretty secretive about their operations so no one really knows how much data Google has. And it's like no one really knows how many data centers Google has. Except you know people at Google itself. And I've tried I've met them a few times to try to ask him them. And there they aren't revealing anything. So I decided to try to figure this out myself there are a few things that I looked at here I started with money Google has to reveal how much they spend in general and I let you put some caps on how much you know how many data centers could they be building is a big data center costs a certain amount of money and you can also then put a cap on how much of the world hard drive Market. Are they taking up which turns out. It's pretty sizable. I'm ready calculation one point. I think Google has a drive failure about every minute or two and they just threw out the hard drive and swapping a new one so they go through a huge number of them. And so I looking at money you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have you can also look at Power. You can look at how much electricity do they need because you need a certain amount of electricity to run servers and Google is more efficient than most but they still have some basic requirements and that lets you put a limit on the number of servers they have you can also look at square footage and see how many you know update centers that you know how big are they. How much room is that how many server racks could you fit in there and for some data centers you might get two of these pieces of information you know how much they spent and you also say because they had to contract with the local government to get the power provided you might know what they made a deal to to buy see how much power it takes a look at the ratios of those numbers and figure out for a Datacenter we don't have any information you can figure out it. But maybe you only have one of those you know the square footage then you can figure out well maybe the power is proportional and you can do the same thing with a lot of different quantities guesses about the total amount of storage the number of servers the number of drives per server and in each case using what you know to come up with the model that narrows down your guesses for the things that you don't know the sort of circling around the number you're trying to get end. And this is a lot of fun. It's. It's the math. Is not all that advanced and. Really it. It's like nothing more than solving a Sudoku puzzle. And so what I did so. I went through all of this information you know spend a day or two researching. And there's some things I didn't look at you. Could always look at the Google recruitment messages if they post that gives you an idea of where they have people sometimes when people visited data center looks like a cell cam photo and post it. And they aren't supposed to. But you can learn things about the hardware that way. And in fact you can just look at pizza delivery drivers. Turns out they know where all the Google data centers are at least the ones that have people in them. But I came up with my estimate which I felt pretty good about that. Was about about 10 exabytes of data across all Google's operations and in another maybe 5 exabytes or so of offline storage in like tape. Dr. Google is about the world's largest consumer of. So I came up with this. Is a staggering amount of data. It's quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has as far as we know there is a couple other contenders specially the NSA but using some of these same methods we can look at the nsa's data centers and and figure out you know. We don't know what's going on there. But it's pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google's adding all of the stuff I came up with the other thing that we can answer which is how many Punch Cards would this take and so a punch card can hold about 80 characters and you can fit about you know 2,000 or so Cards into a box and you put them in say my home region of New England it would cover the entire region up to a depth of a little less than 5 km which is about three times deeper than the glaciers during the last ice age about 20,000 years ago. So this is this is Impractical. But I think that's the. That's about the best answer. I could come up with and I posted on my website. And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google because of course. They've been so secretive they didn't answer any of my questions and. And so I just put up and said well I guess we'll never know. But then a little while later I got a message couple weeks later from Google saying hey there is an envelope for you. So I go and get it open it up. And it's Punch Cards Google Brandon Punch Cards. And on these Punch Cards there are a bunch of holes. And it's a puzzle there is a bunch of code I guess I had friends to help. And we we crack the code and inside that is another code. And then there's some equations. And then we saw those equations and then finally an end out pops a message from Google which is their official answer to my article. And it said no comment. So I and I love calculating these kinds of things. I just ate. And it's not that I love doing the math I do a lot of math. But I don't really like math for its own sake. What I love is that he lets you take some things that you know and just by doing these moving symbols around a piece of paper find out something. You that you didn't know. That's very surprising you know. And I have a lot of stupid questions. And I love that math gives the power to answer them sometimes and sometimes not this is a question I got from a reader an anonymous reader and the subject line. Just said urgent and this was the entire email if people had wheels and could fly how would we differentiate them from airplanes urgent and I think there are some questions that math just cannot answer thank you. </p>
