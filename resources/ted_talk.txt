 what do all of these things have in common aside from that their photos that I took in the last 3 months and therefore own the copyright to

 they're all inventions that were created with the benefit of language existed without language of those things or like building an entire building like this without being able to use language or without benefiting from any knowledge that was God by the use of language basically a language is the most important thing in the entire world all of our civilization rests upon it and those who devote their lives to studying at both how language emerge how human languages differ how they differ from animal communication systems are linguists formal Linguistics is a relatively young field more or less important stuff like for example that human communication systems differ crucially from animal communication system that all languages are equally expressive even if they do it in different ways and yet

 despite this there are a lot of people who just love to pop off about language like they have an equal understanding of it as a linguist because of course they speak a language in if you speak a language that means you have just as right to talk about its function as anybody else imagine like if you were talking to a surgeon and you say listen buddy I got a heart for like 40 years now I think I know a thing or two about aortic valve replacement I think my opinion is just as valid as yours and yet that's exactly what happens this is Neil deGrasse Tyson saying that in the film arrival he would have brought a cryptographer somebody who can unscramble a message in a language they already know rather than a linguist to communicate with the aliens because what would a linguist why would that be speaking a language we don't even know the horse the arrival film is not off the hook I mean come on listen film hey buddy there aliens that come down to our plan in gigantic ships and they want to do nothing

 except for communicate with us and You Higher One linguist

 the US government on a budget or something anyway so

 a lot of these things can we talk to the misunderstandings both about what language is in about the formal study of language about Linguistics and I think that there's something that underlies a lot of these misunderstandings that can be summed up by this delightful article in Forbes about why high school students shouldn't learn foreign languages I'm going to pull out some quotes from this and I want you to see if you can figure out what underlies some of these opinions and ideas Americans rarely read the classics even in Translation so in other words why bother learning a foreign language when they're not even going to read the classic in the original anyway but what's the point of studying foreign languages in school is a waste of time compared to other things that you could be doing in school Europe has a lot of language groups clustered in a relatively small spacer for Americans what's the point of learning another language you're not really going to get a lot of bang for your buck

 this is my favorite student Birmingham would have to travel about a thousand miles to get to the Mexican border and even then there would be enough people to speak English to get around so

 all right if you can kind of wave your arms around and you can get to where you're going then there's really no point in learning another language anyway what underlies a lot of these attitudes is the conceptual metaphor language is a tool and there's something that Rings very true about this metaphor language is kind of a tool and that if you know the local language you can do more than if you didn't but the implication is that language is only a tool in this is absolutely false if language wasn't really would honestly be a pretty poor tool and we would have abandoned long ago for something that was a lot better I'll give you an example to think about any sense there's a sense that I'm sure it said in my life yesterday I saw can I have a friend named Ken and when I say this when I say the sentence yesterday I saw can it do you think it's really the case that everything in my mind is now implanted in your mind via this sentence hardly because there's a lot of other stuff going on like when I say yesterday and I think what the weather was like yesterday because I was there and if I'm remembering now probably remember that there was something I forgot to mail which I

 actually this is funny this is a pre-plan joke but I really did forget to mail something and so I don't have to do it Monday at supposed to cuz that's what I'm going to get back home when I think of Monday I'll think of Manic Monday by The Bangles it's a good song and when I say the word saw I think of this phrase I see said the blind man as he picked up his hammer and saw I always do anytime I hear the words I always think of that because my grandfather always used to say it's that makes me think of my grandfather or back to Manic Monday again for some reason and with Ken when I'm talking when I'm saying something like yesterday I saw can I will consider think of the circumstances under which I saw him and this happened to be that day areas of my cat and of course if I'm picking up Ken and I'll think that he's going to Long Beach State right now and I will remember that my good friend John my mother both graduated from Long Beach State my cousin Katie is going to Long Beach State right now and spending Monday again

 but really like this is just a fraction of what's going on in your head at any given time while you were speaking and all we have to represent the entire mess that is going on in our head it is this I mean that's all we got is it any wonder that are our system is so poor so imagine if I can give you knowledge Emagine like if you wanted to know what is it like to eat a cake If instead of just eating the cake you instead had to ingest the ingredients of a cake one by one along with instructions about how these ingredients can be combined to form a cake Yeti the instructions if that was how we had to experience take we would never eat cake and yet language is the only way the only way that we can figure out what is going on here in our mine this is our interiority the thing that makes us human think that makes us different from other animals is all inside here somewhere and all we have to do.

 resent it is our own language has a language of their best way of showing what's going on in her head so imagine if I wanted to ask a big question like what is the nature of human thought and emotion what you'd want to do is you want to examine as many different languages as possible one isn't just going to do it to give you an example here's a picture I took a little Roman it's a that I took with a 12 megapixel camera now here's that same picture with a lot fewer pixels obviously neither of these pictures of pictures of the real cat but one gets you a lot better sense of what a cat is in the other language is not merely a tool it is our Legacy their way of conveying what it means to be human and Horse by Our by our Legacy I mean all humans everywhere and losing even one language makes that picture a lot less clear so as a as a job for the past 10 years and also as Recreation

 for fun I create languages these are called, and said shorts for constructed languages now presenting these facts back-to-back that were losing languages on our planet and that I create brand new he might think there's some non superficial connection between these two in fact a lot of people live in between those dots this is the guy got all bent out of shape but there was a conlang in James Cameron's Avatar he says

 but in the three years it took James Cameron to get Avatar 2 the screen a language died probably a lot more than that actually not be a last won't fill the hole where it used to be a truly profound employment statement if you don't think about it at all but when I was here until I completed to Majors one of them was Linguistics but the other one was English and of course the English major the study of English is not actually the study of the English language as we know it's the study of literature literature is still wonderful thing because basically literature more broadly it's kind of like or tried it falls under the rubric of Art and what we do with literature authors create new entire beans in history I have to end it's interesting to us to see what kind of depth in a motion and and just unique Spirit authors can invest into these fictional be so much so that I need to take out take a look at this entire series of books that are written

 about fictional characters like the entire book is just about one fictional fake human beings there's an entire book on Georgia ballot from Sinclair Lewis Babbitt and I guarantee you that book is longer than Babbitt which is a short book is anybody remember that when it was pretty good I actually think it's better than Main Street that's that's my hot take any way the crazy thing about never question the fact that literature is interesting but despite the fact not even linguist are actually interested in what created languages can tell us about the depth of the human Spirit just as an artistic Endeavor I'll give you a I'll give you a nice little example here there was a there's an article written on me about me in the California Alumni magazine a while back and when they wrote this article they wanted to get somebody from the opposing side which in hindsight seems like a weird thing to do and you're just talking about a person and you want to get somebody from the opposing side of that person

 I need a freshly this is just a puff piece but whatever anyway to self happened to get one of the most brilliant linguist of our time George lakoff is a linguist here at Berkeley and his work is based be forever changed the fields of linguistics and cognitive science and when asked about my work in about language Creation in general he said but there's a lot of things to be done in the study of language you should spend the time on something real something real does this remind you of anything to use the very framework that he himself invented let me refer back to this conceptual metaphor language is a tool the appears to be laboring under this conceptual metaphor and his language is useful when it can be used for communication language is useless when it can't be used for communication 9th Wonder make you wonder what would we do with dead languages but anyway so because of this idea it might seem like the very height of absurdity to have a Duolingo course on the highway

 learning language that I created for HBO's Game of Thrones am I wonder what exactly are 740,000 people learning well

 what's what's let's take a look at it what are they learning what could they possibly be learning well very in mind that the other language for this it's for people that speak English speakers are learning quite a bit here so here's a sentence that they will probably never use for communication in their entire lives but the man sees the woman in the Bold the little middle line is the gloss so it's word for word that's what it says I don't actually learning some very fascinating things especially if your English speakers they're learning that average income at the very end of a sentence doesn't really do that in English when you have two arguments are learning that there isn't sometimes the language doesn't have an equivalent for the word that it's just totally absent that something language can do their learning that a long bow can actually be longer and duration as opposed to a different quality which is what are long vowels do they're actually the same like they're learning that there are these little inflections there infections are called cases on

 that tell you who does what to whom in a sentence even if you leave the order of the words that the same and switch the endings it changes who does what to whom what they're learning is that languages do things the same things differently in other languages can be fun

 what they're learning is respect for language capital L language and given the fact that 88% of Americans only speak English at home I don't think that's necessarily A Bad Thing language has died on our planet that is not because the government imposes a one language on a smaller group or because an entire group of speakers wiped out that certainly has happened in the past and it's happening now but it's not the main reason the main reason is that a child is born to a family that speaks a language that is not widely spoken in their community and that child doesn't learn it why because that language is not valued in their Community because the language isn't useful because the child can't go and get a job if they speak that language because if language is just a tool

 been wearing their late their native language is about as useful as learning High Valyrian so why bother

 out

 maybe language study isn't going to lead to a lot more linguistic fluency but maybe that's not such a big deal

 maybe if more people are studying more languages it will lead to more linguistic tolerance and less linguistic imperialism maybe we actually respect language for what it is literally the greatest invention in the history of humankind men in the future we can celebrate endangered languages as living languages as opposed to museum pieces thank you
