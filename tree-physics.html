      <p>Sometimes the simplest questions have the most amazing answers like how can trees be so tall is a question that doesn't even seem like it needs an answer trees just start all some of them are over a hundred why should there be a height limit I'll tell you why trees need to transport water from their Roots up until their topmost branches in order to survive and that is no trivial task there was a limit to the height that water can be sucked up a tube its 10 if you suck on a long vertical straw the water will go no higher than 10 Mi at this point the perfect vacuum at the top of the straw and the water will start to boil spontaneouslyfor a tree to raise water a hundred it would have to create a pressure difference of 10 atmospheres how would trees do that when I post this conundrum a lot of people said the answer is transpiration and that's when water evaporates from the leaf pulling up the water molecules behind it. And that's clearly a mechanism that we can use to create suction. But it doesn't help us overcome this 10 meter limit your vacuum which I imagine is not happening inside of tree leaves right right tank. So you might suspect that a tree does not contain continuous straw-like tubes tree effectively has vowels in it so you didn't have a column of water they speak to what you're saying needs to be filled with water is actually made up of cells although these are good speculations they don't turn out to be correct scientist who study trees. Find that the xylem tubes that transport water do contain a continuous water column so how else could the tree transport water from the roots to the leaves they don't stop they don't use a vacuum. Okay. So how do they do it all the way up. Three muscles in there besides being a giant waste of energy all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes are dead what about osmotic pressure If there is more solute in the roots in the surrounding soil water would be pushed off the tree but some trees live in mangroves where the water is so salty that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other direction so the tree needs additional pressure to suck water the tree then it must be capillary action the thinner the tube the higher the water can climb for the tubes in a tree are too wide at 22200 micrometers in diameter water should rise less than a meter so how did trees do it well one of the assumptions we made is wrong when you eliminate all of the gas molecules the pressure is 0 and you have a perfect vacuum butt in a liquid you can go lower than zero pressure and actually get Negative pressures in a solid we would think of this as tension this means that the molecules are pulling on each other and their surroundings as the water evaporates from the pores of the cell wall they create a mint negative pressure of -15 atmospheres in an average tree think about the air-water interface at the poor there is one atmosphere of pressure pushing in and -15 atmospheres of suction on the other side so wide the meniscus break because the pores are tiny only 225 nanometers in diameter at this scale Waters high surface tension ensures the air-water boundary can withstand huge pressures without caving As you move down the tree the pressure increases atmospheric at the roots so you can have a large pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the tree because the pressure at the top is so negative but hang on if the pressure of the top is -15 atmospheres. Shouldn't the water be boiling. Yes. Yes it should but changing phase from liquid to gas requires activation energy. And I can come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny air bubble. That's why it's so important to the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they can do this because I'm like a straw they've been water-filled from the start this way water remains in the metastable liquid state when it really should be boiling. It's just like supercooled water remains liquid even though it should be ice you could say that the water in a tree is super sucked because it remains liquid at such negative pressures and why are trees moving all this water up the tree I want you to make. A guess say it out loud for photosynthesis actually no less than 1% of the water is used in photosynthetic reactions any other ideas. Okay what about growth. Well 5% of the water is used to make yourself just evaporates for each molecule of carbon dioxide a tree takes in. It loses hundreds of molecules of water. Can you believe how amazing this is trees create huge negative pressures of tens of Atmosphere by evaporating water through nanoscale pores sucking water up a hundred in a state where it should be boiling because the perfect just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide I will never look at trees. The same way again I'd like to say a huge thank you to Hank Henry and Professor for making on camera hypotheses this is an essential part of the scientific process even if your hypothesis turns out to be wrong as Einstein said a person who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new wondered what it would be like to be on this side if you weren't already subscribed. You may just learn something I'd also like to thank professor John Sperry from the University of Utah he walked me through all of this in an hour-long Skype conversation. So I'm going to put a link to his website in the description we're looking at pressures here below atmospheric. Is that right this is liquid pressure mouth gas pressure so it's a common misconception that all you can't have you no negative pressure is because there's no molecules left you know the definition of pure vacuum is 0 molecules that for gas just to be clear I told him about this idea in London. And I felt like I'm just blown with this whole thing he said he was going to be really hard to explain. And you know when he says it's hard to explain you know things are going to be. So thank you for all your input to the script and thank you for watching making this video has been a real Odyssey for me so thank you for joining me on that journey I really appreciate all of your comments and if you haven't subscribe to the channel. Already are you can click The annotation or click the link above and I join me on my next scientific Adventure I made a video of promising to make a video about the answer to this proposed the problem like a couple months ago and I was like subscribe to the channel I'll give you the answer next week driving to the right frequency. </p>
